  Section-2-CMFI = ? SECTION 2: THE METAPROGRAM FOR FORMAL INQUIRY (CMFI) IN AN EVOLVED CONTEXT. With the syntax of our evolved metalanguage established, we now turn to the semantic and logical framework used to reason about it: the Categorical Metaprogram for Formal Inquiry (CMFI). The fundamental definitions of categorical structures remain unchanged, as they are universal mathematical abstractions. However, their application within our system is now significantly more profound. The CMFI provides the tools to model processes that are aware of modular imports, conditional configurations, annotations, and deprecation states. For example, a validation process, previously a simple functor, must now be modeled as a functor that maps a complex object—comprising a set of grammar files, a set of configuration flags, and a library of trusted sources—to an equally complex result, which includes not only a boolean validity status but also a collection of errors and warnings. Within this evolved context, these constructs model more sophisticated operations. The process of taking a grammar source file with IMPORT and IFDEF directives and producing a single, concrete grammar for parsing is modeled as a resolution functor, F_resolve. This functor maps an object in the category of source artifacts and configurations to an object in the category of concrete grammars. The validation of this composite artifact is modeled as a state monad, where the state now includes the set of imported rules and the list of generated deprecation warnings. Furthermore, natural transformations provide the formal tool to prove equivalences between configurations. For instance, we can construct a natural transformation alpha: F_resolve(-, config_A) => F_resolve(-, config_B) to prove that a "debug" configuration and a "production" configuration are structurally equivalent with respect to their core logic, differing only in ways that are formally verifiable. ?; @section("2")
