  CHL-Proof-Formulation = Proof-Begin, Step-1, Step-2, Step-3, Step-4, Proof-End;
  Proof-Begin = ? PROOF_BEGIN: Curry-Howard-Lambek guarantees the self-proving nature of the evolved, configurable system; Let the category of source grammar artifacts (files, configurations) be denoted C_Source. Let the resolution functor be F_resolve: C_Source -> C_ConcreteGrammar. The CMFI, as defined in Section 2, provides the logical framework for this resolution. ?;
  Step-1 = ? STEP_1_PROPOSITIONAL_INTERPRETATION: By the CHL correspondence, a proposition is a type. In our evolved system, a proposition can be dependent on configuration. For example: "The grammar is valid given that the 'debug_mode' flag is active." This is a dependent type. The EBNF definitions for conditional-block and import-statement are syntactic sugar for constructing such dependently-typed propositions about the grammar's structure. ?;
  Step-2 = ? STEP_2_PROGRAMMATIC_INTERPRETATION: A "program" is now a complete specification object from C_Sourceâ€”that is, a set of source files and a specific configuration. The "proof" is the successful execution of the resolution functor F_resolve on this object. If the resolution completes without error, yielding a valid object in C_ConcreteGrammar, then this computational process itself serves as a constructive proof of the proposition that the specified configuration is valid. ?;
  Step-3 = ? STEP_3_CATEGORICAL_STRUCTURE_AND_VERIFICATION: The verification process, modeled by monadic and functorial structures from the CMFI, is the proof-checker. The Validation_Functor is the mechanism that checks for namespace collisions from IMPORT directives and validates the internal consistency of IFDEF blocks. Its successful execution on a configuration is the mechanical normalization of the proof term, confirming the system's integrity under those specific conditions. The issuance of DEPRECATE warnings is a side-effect captured by the monad, providing proof-relevant information without invalidating the core proposition of structural soundness. ?;
  Step-4 = ? STEP_4_RECURSIVE_SELF_PROVABILITY: The self-referential loop is now stronger. The EBNF grammar defines its own advanced features (IMPORT, IFDEF, etc.). The CMFI, also defined in this EBNF, provides the logic to verify systems using these features. Therefore, the system's own source code, which is necessarily modular and configurable, can be formally verified by the very principles it codifies. The system can prove that its own evolution engine, E_Evolve, is sound across its different possible configurations, thus achieving a more robust and dynamic form of self-provability. ?;
  Proof-End = ? PROOF_END. ?;

  Section-3-CHL = ? SECTION 3: THE CURRY-HOWARD-LAMBEK ISOMORPHISM: PROVABILITY ACROSS CONFIGURATIONS. The Curry-Howard-Lambek (CHL) correspondence remains the keystone that connects our syntactic definitions and categorical models to a framework of logical proof. In our evolved system, its implications are even more profound. The isomorphism of "propositions as types" and "proofs as programs" now extends to encompass the entire configuration of a grammar. A "proof of correctness" is no longer merely a single, well-typed artifact but a demonstration that a whole collection of source files, imports, and configuration flags resolves into a logically consistent and sound system. ?; @section("3")
